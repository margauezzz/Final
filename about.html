                <h1>HISTORY</h1>
                <p>
                    In November 1985, when the <strong>Lechon Manok</strong> craze was sweeping the nation, Dwight and
                    Dolores
                    Salcedo pooled P5,000 from their savings and borrowed another P5,000 from their parents to put
                    up their own kiosk. They named it <strong>Baliwag Lechon Manok</strong>, after Dolores’ hometown of
                    Baliwag, Bulacan.
                    <br><br>
                    Over the years, they have added other well-loved items into their menu such as <strong>liempo</strong>
                    and <strong>chicharon</strong>. They have also expanded their food business to include restaurants and
                    fast food outlets.
                    <br><br>
                    The simple and grounded ways with which the couple has handled their business have allowed Baliwag to
                    become one of the most iconic Filipino brand names nearly 25 years after it was started and, God
                    willing, for decades more.

                <h1>WHY "BALIWAG"?</h1>
                <p>
                    Born and raised in Baliwag, Bulacan, Dolores believed that the mention of her hometown <strong>evoked
                        memories of true Filipino food and hospitality</strong>. She said, “If the name can have that same
                    effect on the ordinary Filipino, the business just might have a good chance of succeeding.”

            <div class="column">
                <h1>VISION</h1>
                <p>
                    Baliwag Lechon Manok hopes to maintain its status as a true household name, serving more people via
                    accessible kiosks, outlets, and dine-in restaurants in major cities and other key locations worldwide.

                    Baliwag Lechon Manok aims to provide easy access to its patrons by opening more outlets in strategic
                    locations worldwide through company-led efforts and through franchising.

                        the Family comes
                        first, whether it be providing quality services to its treasured customers or dealing with members
